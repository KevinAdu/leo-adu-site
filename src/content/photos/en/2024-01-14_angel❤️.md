  Ultrasound scan on the 36th week.

  I was happy to see our son's cute sleeping face. It was like an angel to me.

  In the last 2 weeks, Leo gained 500 grams so I was worried he is getting too big to fast but his weight weight this checkup was 3,100g.

  When I eat, Leo always starts moving in my belly. Makes we wonder if he his gonna have a large appetite 😂
